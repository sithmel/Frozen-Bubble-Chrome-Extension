Frozen bubble HTML5
===================
This is a HTML5 version of Frozen bubble. Basically I started from the chrome extension (see below).

I fixed compatibility issue (it used webkit prefixed method)
I fixed some performance issue (using requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval)
I added a basic touch support and mobile compatibility.
